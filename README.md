### Hi there 👋 I'm Miguel

I'm a Systems Engineering student, i like everything related to backend and software development such as databases, networks and security. Although i'm not an expert, i love to learn new things and understand how everything works.

My main project is <a href="https://goodgameweb.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Good Game (GG)</a>, a web platform where you can find gaming communities and connect with other players via the communities social networks; it was developed by me using Flask.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🐍 Python is my main language, but i also know some C++, Java and JavaScript
- 💻 basic-internediate knowledge in HTML5 and CSS3
- 🔭 I’m currently working on new project ideas
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Django and NoSQL databases
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project where i can use my skills and learn new ones.
- 💬 Ask me about my project Good Game!
